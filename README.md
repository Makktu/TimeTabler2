# TIMETABLER

Simple Timetable app. using Vanilla JS with modules

To be added before reaching the 'basic functionality' target:

- Save current state to local storage
- Color options for user
- Fill in surrounding cells with entered topic/color

Stretch goals (can save these for the React version):

- User can choose Day/Time from dialogue box/modal, rather than click and enter on the table itself
- Save current state to other storage
