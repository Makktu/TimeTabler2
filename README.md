# TIMETABLER

Simple Timetable app. using Vanilla JS with modules

To be added before reaching the 'basic functionality' target:

- Save current state to local storage
- Color options for user
- Fill in surrounding cells with entered topic/color

Stretch goals (can save these for the React version):

- User can choose Day/Time from dialogue box/modal, rather than click and enter on the table itself
- Save current state to other storage

---

1. When the app loads:

- check local storage for savedata and load it if it is there
- start the app in vanilla form if there is no save data
- when the user clicks Save:
  -
